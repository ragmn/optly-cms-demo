These instructions assume that you've just received the e-mail with login information for the CMS and are able to login to the fresh CMS instance.

- [2. Configure the channel](#2-configure-the-channel)
- [3. Configure the languages](#3-configure-the-languages)
- [4. Update content in Optimizely Graph](#4-update-content-in-optimizely-graph)
- [5. Update the Header/Footer configuration](#5-update-the-headerfooter-configuration)

### 1. Import the content pack

After clicking "Begin Import", you should see a loader during the import. After import, a results section should appear, which summarized the number of imported items.

### 2. Configure the channel
With the content now imported, the next step is to do the initial configuraiton of the channel. This will allow the website to connect to the content and render it.

- Navigate to "Settings" (cog icon on the left-hand side) - and then go to "Manage Websites" under "Config"
- Click on "Create website" to create a new channel definition
- Fill out the form as follows:


| Field | Instruction |
| - | - |
| Name | The name for the channel, use "Mosey Bank" or a name you've selected yourself
| URL | Copy the URL from your browser and remove everything after the domain. So `https://example.cms.optimizely.com/ui/EPIServer.Cms.UI/...` becomes `https://example.cms.optimizely.com/` |
| Start page | Select the start page of the channel, that is "Mosey Bank" for the included content pack |
| Use site-specific assets | Checking this option will allow you to store assets at a channel level. |

- Click on the ***Name*** of the website you've just created, you should now see same form again, with the settings you've just created **and** the first host defined.
- Click on the "Add Host" button and create the following settings:

| Field | Instruction |
| - | - |
| Host Name | Put in a single asterisk (*) |

### 3. Configure the languages
The last step is to have the available languages match the languages in the content pack.

### 4. Update content in Optimizely Graph
To make sure the content upload and configuration changes from the previous steps are reflected in Optimizely Graph, take the following steps:

- Navigate to "Settings" (cog icon on the left-hand side) - and then go to "Scheduled Jobs" under "Scheduled Jobs"
- Filter the job-list for "Graph" and click the "Optimizely Graph content synchronization job"
- Click the "Start" button on the "Details" page that has just been opened, the status should change to "Running", with status updates next to it.
- Once the status returns to "IDLE" the synchronization process has completed.

The content will now be reflected correctly by Optimizely Graph

    - Click the "Settings" icon of the "Navigation pane" (right top, left of "pin") and click "Add Gadgets"
    - Search for "Multi" and click "Multi-Channel Content"
    - Scroll within the "Navigation pane" to make the "Multi-Channel Content" visible
