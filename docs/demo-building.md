### 1. Applying customer colors
The frontend leverages [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) to apply styling, such that new components can easily be styled. In order to allow for easy application of customer colors to the site, a number of additional high-level colors have been defined (primary, secondary, stripe & default).

All included components take their colors from these color-definitions. These colors can be configured by changing the [tailwind.config.js](../apps/frontend/tailwind.config.js) to match the desired color scheme.
